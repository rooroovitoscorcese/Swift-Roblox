## 🤯 Yo, What's Swift?
**Swift ain't your grandma's executor** - it's that next-gen juice 💉 for Roblox that makes scripts run STUPID fast ⚡ while keeping you low-key 👻. We're talking quantum-level performance without the laggy BS.

```lua

Swift:ClapBack({
  script = "GodMode",
  stealth = "ninja",
  swag = "max"
})
```

```diff
